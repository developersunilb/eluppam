            🌴 Kerala – The Culture That Lives in You

            No matter how far you’ve traveled, how many languages you speak, or how many cultures you’ve embraced, there is a rhythm within you that is unmistakably Malayalee. It is the rhythm of Kerala — the land of timeless traditions, lush green landscapes, and a culture that celebrates both simplicity and sophistication.

          <p className="text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Kerala is not just a place; it is a way of life. Our culture teaches us:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
            <li>Respect for all faiths – Hindus, Muslims, and Christians have celebrated each other’s festivals for centuries.</li>
            <li>Equality and dignity – From matrilineal traditions to today’s high literacy, Kerala has always placed value on education and empowerment.</li>
            <li>Harmony with nature – The monsoons, rivers, and coconut groves aren’t just scenery — they remind us that life is richest when lived in balance with the earth.</li>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-kerala-green-800 mb-4">🎭 A Living Tradition of Art</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed">
            From the hypnotic eyes of Kathakali to the fiery spirit of Theyyam, from the grace of Mohiniyattam to the combat discipline of Kalaripayattu, Kerala’s art forms are more than performances — they are experiences of divinity and human expression woven together.

        {/* Festivals Section */}
        <section className="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-xl mb-12">

          <p className="text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed">
            Who can forget the fragrance of the Onam pookalam, the grand feast of the Sadya, or the joy of Vishu kani at sunrise? Even if you’ve missed these celebrations for years, their memory still warms your heart. Kerala’s festivals are not just events — they are reunions of family, community, and spirit.

          <p className="text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed">
            The crunch of banana chips, the aroma of coconut oil, the spice of fish curry, the comfort of parippu and ghee — Kerala cuisine is more than food, it is love served on a banana leaf. No matter where you are, these flavors carry you back to your roots.

          <p className="text-lg text-kerala-green-700 leading-relaxed">
            At the core of Kerala culture is a quiet strength: the value of family, respect for elders, compassion for others, and pride in knowledge. These values have made Malayalees thrive across the world, yet it is in reconnecting with them that we feel truly complete.
