Need to develop a nice next.js game, the graphics and physics should be similar to the consonant arrow game. I will give you the game design now, which is a follows, There should be a shape of a bowling alley with bowling pins and a bowling ball that the player will bowl to hit the bowling pins marked with Malayalam consonant letters, ച, ഛ, ജ, ഝ, ഞ randomly arranged. The game play is like this, the player will using a trajectory physics like in angry birds to knock out the correct consonant bowling pins in order using the black bowling ball. The bowling alley should look like a colorful pop art style retro bowling alley in perspective view and bowling pins should look like like actual bowling pins and the bowling ball drag logic should be smooth like the angry birds style targeting system like in the consonant arrow game.
