Malayalam Mahjong 3D Game – Expanded Scope of Works
🔹 Game Concept

A 3D Mahjong-inspired game rendered in a Roblox-style environment with Malayalam characters instead of Chinese characters. The game blends traditional Mahjong rules with an educational Malayalam twist in a Kerala-inspired setting.

Players match tiles; when matched:

The tile pronounces the Malayalam letter.

The tiles animate (fly off) to a side panel for matched-tile display.

Background music and effects enrich the atmosphere.

🔹 Scope of Works
1. Game Environment (Kerala + Roblox style)

Kerala-inspired Roblox-like environment: nalukettu-style houses, coconut trees, backwaters, and tiled platforms.

Bright but minimalistic art style with soft lighting.

Light ambient animations: moving clouds, swaying trees, water ripple.

2. 3D Tiles with Malayalam Characters

Mahjong-style 3D blocks.

Top face: Malayalam character texture.

Other faces: ivory with subtle shine.

Characters dynamically drawn on canvas textures (so you can easily add all 51+ Malayalam letters).

3. Gameplay Mechanics

Mahjong rules (stacking, blocking, matching).

Tile interaction via raycasting (click/tap detection).

Only free tiles can be selected.

Matching pair logic:

Play Malayalam pronunciation audio.

Animate matched tiles (bounce + fly off to side panel).

Add to scoreboard and matched-tile display.

4. Audio System (Background & Effects)

Background Music:

Light instrumental loop (flute, veena, or calm temple ambiance).

Toggle button in UI (On/Off).

Default: ON at low volume.

Sound Effects:

Tile click: soft “tap” sound.

Tile fly-off: whoosh or swish sound.

Tile match confirmed: subtle chime + pronunciation audio.

Background ambient sounds (optional layering): birds, bells, water trickle.

Malayalam Pronunciations:

Pre-record each Malayalam letter in a clear native voice.

Play immediately on tile click and again on match.

5. UI / UX

Side Panel:

Displays matched tiles in order.

Small glowing highlight when a new pair arrives.

Top HUD:

Score counter.

Timer.

Buttons: Restart, Shuffle, Music Toggle, Tutorial.

Responsive controls:

Orbit, zoom, and reset camera.

Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

6. Animations & Visual Effects

Tile selection: glow/scale-up effect.

Matched tiles: bounce + fly-off to side panel.

Small confetti burst or particle sparkle when matches occur.

Environment animations: day–night transition (stretch goal).

7. Multiplatform Deployment

Web-first (Next.js + react-three-fiber).

Optimized for desktop & mobile WebGL.

PWA-ready (offline play + home-screen install).

8. Stretch Goals (Future)

Word mode: match tiles to form valid Malayalam words.

Multiplayer competitive mode.

Festival themes: Onam, Vishu, Pooram.

Leaderboards & achievements.

⚡ Suggested Prompt (AI/freelancer brief):

"Build a 3D Malayalam Mahjong game using Next.js + Three.js (react-three-fiber) with Malayalam letters instead of Chinese characters. Include Mahjong gameplay mechanics (stacking, blocking, matching). When tiles are matched, play Malayalam pronunciation audio, animate the tiles flying off to a side panel, and update the score. Add a Roblox-style Kerala-inspired environment (houses, coconut trees, backwaters) with simple but beautiful rendering. Include background music that can be toggled on/off, and sound effects for tile clicks, flying off, and successful matches. Provide a clean UI with score, timer, restart, shuffle, tutorial, and matched-tile display. The code should be modular, optimized for browser, and PWA-ready."
